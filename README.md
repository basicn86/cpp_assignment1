# cpp_assignment1

This is my first C++ assignment. This program asks for the user to input a number of seconds. It then breaks down the amount of hours, minutes, and seconds in the number the user inputted.

This repository is meant for educational purposes only. I intend to use this website as storage for my class assignments and projects.
